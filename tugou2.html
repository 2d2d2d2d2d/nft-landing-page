                                are about to take a turn that is unlike anything we have experienced before as a

                                to write dozens of books, but the idea behind our collection is to help anyone become a
                                community member by simply understanding the core of the NFT world and the way in which

                            <h1>NFT Story</h1>
                            <p>There is no denying that we are now living in a world that is completely changed by
                                restrictions on global borders. The entire planet is moving towards a new way of life,
                                but it is one that limits the way that we are able to conduct business.</p>
                            <p>Many aspects of society as we know it today are crumbling right before our eyes. We are
                                headed into a serious change and most of the world is not prepared for the transition.
                                It may seem like this is a time for distress, but instead, it is a time that brings very
                                positive changes into our lives.</p>
                            <p>In times when digital communication is so seamless, we seem to be unable to take full
                                advantage of it, but that is all about to change. We are soon to be involved in what is
                                the greatest and most relevant change we have seen so far</p>
                            <p>We are headed into the Metaverse. This is a new alternate reality that we can control
                                without fear of restrictions in the process of development, and financial growth. This
                                world is a completely new and very exciting place to be, and Soland is the ultimate
                                virtual financial community to help you make this important transition.</p>
                            <p>Make no mistake about it; we are going to live in this world just as much as we live in
                                the traditional world. It is not ideal to say “real” and “virtual”. The truth is that
                                the digital world that we experience in the Metaverse is going to be just as real as the
                                one you experience online.</p>
                            <p>You will be living in a city that is full of line, within a metaverse that is highly
                                engaging and full of options that give us a vast number of opportunities that seem so
                                out of reach today. Humanity has yet to witness the incredible changes that are coming
                                and Soland City wants to offer the perfect community that will be there for each other
                                during this essential transition.</p><br><br>
                            <h1>NFT Utility</h1>
                            <p>When we started Soland City, the idea was to create a powerful community that will grow
                                together and create a strong presence in the vastness of the Metaverse. Your NFT value
                                is something that can skyrocket without limitations and that is one of the most exciting
                                aspects of this journey.</p>
                            <p>With that said, the true value of your Soland NFT collection acquisition comes in the
                                form of community support. Not only that, but also in the feeling that you are part of
                                something bigger and something that allows you to make this intimidating transition much
                                easier to handle.</p>
                            <p>It is thanks to the power of community that we have been able to move forward and evolve
                                as a species. Strength has always been in numbers and this is even more relevant and
                                true now that we are headed into such a massively new and promising future.</p>
                            <p>It is the power of community that gives the highest value to our collection. It goes
                                beyond the value of the NFT itself and it turns into a passport that makes you a member
                                of an exclusive community and anactive citizen of the Metaverse.</p>
                            <p>There was a time when this all seemed like science fiction, but the Metaverse is real and
                                we are going to merge the offline world with the online world in ways that are
                                incredibly creative and efficient.</p>
                            <p>The global Soland will give you the power to evolve within the Metaverse and to create
                                business opportunities that have a longer and much more reliable reach.</p>

                                <p>In 2021, many developers shifted away from Ethereum and toward alternative
                                    blockchains. Because high gas prices and congestion still plague the Ethereum
                                    network. Solana was one of the networks that reaped the biggest benefits from this
                                    situation. Its meteoric rise since 2021 has established it as one of Ethereum's main
                                    competitors. Solana can do more transactions per unit of time and offers lower fees
                                    than Ethereum. We're rebranding Solana and taking it to the next level with the 3D
                                    Metaverse Soland City, using the same defi approach as Ethereum.</p>
                                <p>Even though Ethereum is older and more well-known, Solana is a genuine competitor.
                                    One concern is that Ethereum's potential for global-scale applications is
                                    essentially limited by the limited number of transactions per second that it can
                                    enable. Solana can process tens of thousands of transactions every second, whereas
                                    Ethereum can only process roughly 13 transactions per second. Furthermore, Solana
                                    provides "significantly lower costs." One of the most prominent critiques leveled at
                                    Ethereum is its high transaction costs.</p>

                                    collection. To present, the blue-chip enterprise has a market valuation of almost
                                    $503 million (at the time of writing). The exhibit features 10,000 "smoothest
                                    brained" apes displaying "degenerate behavior." The NFT also offers its bearers
                                    utility and exclusive access to the "Academy."</p>
                                <p>Like many other well-known companies, Degen Ape is supported by a large community. It
                                    has more than 82,000 Twitter followers but just 18,000 Discord members. The

                            The longer you hold on to your NFT as the community grows, the more value it will gain over
                            the years simply due to the community value behind it. With that said, there are many other
                            factors that will alter the value of your NFT, but that is the core principle.</div>
